# Tax Document Processing System

This project is an automated tax document processing system built using [N8N](https://n8n.io/) for workflow automation, OpenAI, AWS, and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) with Postgres for backend and database management. It integrates various technologies and APIs to process and analyze documents, audio, and text data related to tax processing.

Additionally, the system is designed to integrate with a **WeWeb-based client portal**, allowing clients to interact with their tax-related data in a secure and user-friendly environment.

## Overview

The system consists of three main workflows:

### 1. Document Processing Workflow
- **Purpose:** Monitors an email inbox or cloud storage for incoming tax documents such as W-2s, 1099s, and invoices.
- **Key Features:**
  - Extraction of attachments and processing of images and PDFs.
  - Use of AWS Textract for OCR to extract text from scanned images.
  - Classification of document types using AI (via OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-turbo).
  - Storing document metadata and extracted data in Supabase.
  - Similarity search using document embeddings to flag inconsistencies.

### 2. Audio Processing Workflow
- **Purpose:** Processes audio files uploaded to cloud storage that contain recorded tax consultation conversations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Triggers on new audio files (MP3, WAV) using Google Drive triggers.
  - Transcription of audio using Whisper AI or OpenAI Speech-to-Text.
  - Extraction of financial entities (SSNs, tax IDs, income figures) from transcriptions via AI.
  - Storage of transcribed text and extracted financial data in Supabase.

### 3. Text Processing Workflow
- **Purpose:** Monitors incoming emails for both structured and unstructured text-based tax information.
- **Key Features:**
  - Extraction of text from email bodies and attachments.
  - Analysis of text using NLP to extract relevant financial data.
  - Storage of extracted tax data in Supabase.

## WeWeb Client Portal Integration

To enhance the user experience, a **WeWeb client portal** can be implemented, allowing clients to securely access and manage their tax-related data. This will provide a seamless interface that integrates directly with Supabase for real-time data retrieval and interaction.

## Security & Scalability Enhancements

- **Credential Management:** The repository includes a JSON file for N8N, which defines the workflow UI, but requires the user to configure their own credentials (a list of required environment variables is provided).
- **Improved Email Handling:** The IMAP email node can be replaced with a more secure alternative that offers enhanced cybersecurity features.
- **Scalability:** The workflow is fully scalable, allowing for the integration of additional document types, AI models, and security measures as needed.

## Technologies and Skills Applied

- **N8N (Workflow Automation):** Automated multi-step workflows that integrate different data sources and services.
- **Supabase:** PostgreSQL backend with REST API endpoints and edge functions for data validation and storage.
- **AWS Textract:** OCR technology to extract text from scanned documents.
- **OpenAI / Whisper AI:** Utilized for both text classification and audio transcription, as well as for extracting key financial entities.
- **WeWeb:** Client portal integration for user-friendly access to tax-related data.
- **Environment Variables:** Used to securely manage credentials and configuration details across the workflows.
- **Error Handling:** Implements retry mechanisms, error logging, and alerts to ensure robustness.
- **Modularity and Documentation:** The workflow is modular and documented to facilitate maintenance and further development.
